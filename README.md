Semantic Web - Heart Disease Stroke rate VS Physical Activity Analysis

* The main aim of the project is to demonstrate the relationship between cardiovascular health and maintaining a healthy life. We analyzed both the Heart Disease and the Physical Activity data for each state and demonstrated the relationship between the two, based on ethnicity. We have used two datasets in this project, one gives the information about the Heart Disease and other contains information about the Physical Activity rate.
